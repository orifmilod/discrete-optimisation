# discrete-optimisation
[Discrete/Combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization) techniques applied on different combinatorial problems.

## Algorithms implemented
### Graph-coloring
- [X] [Greedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_coloring#:~:text=In%20the%20study%20of%20graph,vertex%20its%20first%20available%20color) - Just pick the first available color and proceed to the neighbour, backtrack if not feasible.
- [X] [D-satur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSatur) - Color most saturated verices then proceed to neigbours.
